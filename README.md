# TGuserbot
A bot that converts messages that start as ".command" into something else, or starts performing actions.

### Simple commands

".rip" - send cross\
".spoki" - send beautiful "𝚜𝚙𝚘𝚔𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚘𝚒 𝚗𝚘𝚌𝚑𝚒"\


### Hacks

".cube 🎲" - sends an emoji (a cube or a dart or a ball) until the coolest one falls out. The previous ones are deleted\
".type somephrase" - will print everything that is after ".type" by letters (first one letter, then '-' will be added, then it will change to the next letter in the message, and so on, until the entire text is printed)

And other commands, see main.py
